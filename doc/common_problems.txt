1. Common Build Problems and Solutions

The following are errors that you may encounter while building, installing, or
running Rubinius along with suggested solutions.

For any error, a first step is to ensure you have a current, clean checkout of
Rubinius. Before going further, consider running the following steps:

  $ git co master
  $ git reset --hard
  $ git pull
  $ rake distclean
  $ rake


Error:

  ERROR: unable to find runtime directory

  Rubinius was configured to find the runtime directory at:

    /Users/brian/devel/rubinius/runtime

  but that directory does not exist.

  Set the environment variable RBX_RUNTIME to the location
  of the directory with the compiled Rubinius kernel files.

  You may have configured Rubinius for a different install
  directory but you have not run 'rake install' yet.

Solution:

  If you configured rubinius with a --prefix, run rake install.

  If you configured rubinius with a --prefix and renamed the install directory
  after installing Rubinius, re-configure Rubinius and reinstall it.

  If you renamed the source directory after building Rubinius, re-configure
  and rebuild it.

  In general, do not rename the source or build directory after building
  Rubinius.
