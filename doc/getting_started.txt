# Quick Start

The following is a quick summary for building Rubinius. It assumes that you
already have required libraries installed. For a more complete guide, see the
next section.

1. Install [ruby 1.8](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
1. Install [RubyGems](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems)
1. Install Git
1. Clone rubinius: <tt>git clone git://github.com/evanphx/rubinius.git</tt>
1. cd to your rubinius checkout
1. `./configure`
1. `rake`
1. `bin/rbx -v`


# Getting Started

If you are having trouble getting or building Rubinius, the #rubinius IRC
channel on irc://irc.freenode.net can help. You can also ask on the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/rubinius-dev).


## Installing Required Libraries

There are a few things that you need in order to be able to build and run
Rubinius.  Once you have installed the general requirements, install the Gems
needed and then any platform-specific requirements.


### General requirements

* [GCC 4.x (both g++ and gcc)](http://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [GNU Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
* [Ruby version >= 1.8.4 (the Ruby language)](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [RubyGems (Ruby package manager)](http://www.rubygems.org/)
* [Git (source control used by rubinius)](http://git.or.cz/)
* [zlib compression library](http://www.zlib.net/)
* pthread library (provided by the OS)

Most systems already use GNU Make as their default, but for those using a BSD
Make:

* [gmake (GNU Make)](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/

Each package may have requirements of its own, of course.

If you want to avoid overriding your existing environment, you may want to
install everything under its own prefix (such as /usr/local) and to name
programs so they don't collide with your existing installation (such as naming
gmake 'gmake').  You can then adjust your PATH environment variable as needed
for rubinius development.


### Requirements through RubyGems

* rake

Rake may be obtained with the <tt>gem install</tt> command. See <tt>gem
help</tt> and http://www.rubygems.org for more information.

### System-dependent requirements


#### OS X

In order to view backtrace information in the case of
a crash, you need to have:

* XCode + Tools/Utilities

Then, to enable "developer mode" for crash reporting,
the program to use is usually located at:

    /Developer/Applications/Utilities/CrashReporterPrefs.app


#### Debian/Ubuntu family systems

For the build to succeed you will need these packages:

* ruby-dev (or ruby1.8-dev)
* libreadline5-dev
* zlib1g-dev
* libssl-dev


## Getting Rubinius

You need to clone the Rubinius source from the Github repository:

  git clone git://github.com/evanphx/rubinius.git

For more information on Rubinius' best practices for git, see
[Using Git](/using_git.html)


## Compiling Rubinius

First, we need to configure rubinius for your system.

Just run:

   ./configure

This will pull down either a prebuilt LLVM or a source copy that will
be built. If you do not want LLVM (and therefore no JIT), run:

   ./configure --disable-llvm


The C++ VM is compiled using Rake. Typically, it will be as simple as:

    rake
      OR
    rake build

If you plan on doing development work, or otherwise need debug access,
use the +debug+ subtask:

    rake build:debug


## Running VM Tests

Build and run the tests:

  rake vm:test

To run only one test suite, use:

  rake vm:test[SomeClass]

If you want to run a single test suite under gdb, use:

  SUITE="SomeClass" gdb vm/test/runner


## Running the Specs

Rubinius includes a stable copy of the RubySpecs that is tagged so that a
clean set (i.e. passing 100%) of specs can be run as part of the continuous
integration (CI) process. To run the CI specs:

    rake spec

OR

    bin/mspec ci

To run the most current version of RubySpec:

    rake rubyspec:update
    bin/mspec spec/ruby

To run a particular spec file, for example, the Array specs:

    bin/mspec spec/ruby/1.8/core/array


## Installing Rubinius

NOTE: You do NOT need to install Rubinius. Rubinius will run perfectly
from the source directory. If you just want to take Rubinius for a test
run, build in the source directory and either run ./bin/rbx directly or
create a symlink to that file somewhere in your PATH directories.

Now, assuming you really want to install Rubinius...

You can configure Rubinius to install into a single directory, or install
the executable, the core and standard libraries, gems, etc. in multiple
directories.

The simplest is the single-directory install. Run

    ./configure [--enable-llvm] --prefix=/some/path/to/base/dir
    rake install

The rake install task depends on the build task, so rake install will
build and then install.

See `./configure --help` for options for setting the other directories.

NOTE: When Rubinius is built, the path to the directory in which it finds
the core and standard library files is compiled into the exectuable. You
should not move the install (or development) directory after you build
Rubinius. If you do, however, you should get a friendly message about how
to run Rubinius by setting the RBX_RUNTIME and RBX_LIB environment variables.

## Running Rubinius

Once compiled, you can verify the VM works:

    bin/rbx -v

Rubinius generally works like Ruby from the command-line. For example:

    bin/rbx -e 'puts "Hello!"'

To run a ruby file named 'code.rb':

    bin/rbx code.rb

To use the interactive prompt (similar to Ruby's IRB):

    bin/rbx

## Troubleshooting

See [Common Problems](/common_problems.html) or ask questions in the #rubinius
IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.
