A. Yes, as long as your Ruby code runs under MRI 1.8.7.

Q. What platforms are supported?

    Various x86 and x86_64 systems, both in 32-bit and 64-bit mode. The main
    development platforms--and thereby the most stable--are x86 Mac OS X
    (Leopard usually), x86[_64] GNU/Linux (anything from Arch to Gentoo to
    Ubuntu) and x86[_64] *BSD (mainly FreeBSD).

Q. Does it run on Windows?

A. Not yet, but it will eventually. If you are interested in helping, chat
   with us about it in #rubinius IRC channel on irc.freenode.net

Q. Will it run my C extension.

A. It should run your C extension if you do not use anything that depends on
   MRI internals (e.g. RHASH(obj)->tbl). We will attempt to support any
   function from the MRI C-API that we can support. If you depend on a
   function we do not yet implement, file a ticket.

Q. Can I contribute?

A. Yes, please do. See doc/contributing.txt
