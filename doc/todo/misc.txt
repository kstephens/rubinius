# Various Projects to Contribute

There are a lot of "wouldn't it be nice if..." out there. This page collects
some of those.

* Screencasts for various activities like cloning and building Rubinius,
  running specs, making a patch, etc.
* Add RDoc from MRI to all of kernel/**/*.rb.
* Improve docs for GC and object memory.
* Improve docs for Scheduler and Channel.
* Improve docs for FFI.
* Improve docs for VM.
* Add/deploy a CI framework. There are two approaches to this already:

    http://github.com/djwhitt/rubuildius/tree/master
    http://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/tree/shotgun/tools/cluster_test

* Add IRC channel bot that listens to something like rubyspecresults.org for
  particular implementations (configuable) and reports updated results.
* Add storing .rbc files outside of the directory containing the .rb file if
  the directory is not writable. Store the rbc at
  '~/.rubinius/<full_path_to.rb>c'. Should not save the file if 'Process.euid
  == 0' since ENV["HOME"] may not be updated under sudo.
* Investigate using pathname3 as the default pathname implementation. See:
    http://github.com/stouset/pathname3/tree/master
* Run Tinderbox against Rubinius.
